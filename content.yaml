      - The best thing about serving charcuterie at your party is that there are no rules! You can keep it as simple as you like (just the cured meats maybe?) or dress it up with fresh or dried fruits, a variety of artisan breads and crackers, olives, spreads like honey, preserves or jams! You can also keep it budget friendly by setting out a small plate or go all out with a huge platter!
      - Dinner parties, Birthdays, Graduations, Weddings and more, something perfectly crafted with you in the center.
      - Whether you want a charcuterie board for 2 or a grazing table for 300, we have you covered! Our spreads will give your events, regardless of size, the WOW factor they deserve!
